                City Montessori School (CMS) is a co-ed K-12 day school running in 18 campuses across the city of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh. Founded in 1959 by Drs Jagdish and Bharti Gandhi with the motto Jai Jagat (‘victory to the world’) based on the ancient wisdom of Vasudhaiv Kutumbkam (the whole earth is my family) and inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and social reformer Sant Vinobha Bhave. Jai Jagat has been the school's greeting from the beginning.

The school is affiliated to the Delhi-based Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) which offers the ICSE (class 10) and ISC (class 12) qualifications, and is also affiliated with the Cambridge Assessment International Education (CAIE) UK, which offers the iGCSE (class 10) and A-Level (class 12) qualifications. Of the 18 campuses of CMS, five campuses go upto grade 8 and are recognized by the Basic Education Department of the Government of Uttar Pradesh.
